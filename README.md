### Foobar

The “Automatic Stair Light System using Ultrasonic Sensor” project is a simple yet innovative solution to the problem of having to manually switch on the lights when using a staircase.

### Installation

This project presents an automatic stair light system using an ultrasonic sensor. The system is designed to turn on a stair light automatically when a person is detected at the top or bottom of the stairs. The system utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of a person, and then trigger a light switch to turn on the stair light. The system is designed to be energy efficient and cost effective, and is expected to reduce the risk of accidents due to dark staircases. The proposed system is expected to be a feasible solution for improving safety in staircases.

### Objective
The objective of an automatic stair light is to provide a safe and convenient lighting solution for staircases in areas with limited natural lighting. It can be used to light up the stairs and alert people about the presence of stairs in the dark.

#### Components Required
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
- Jumper Wires
- LED’s
- Breadboard
